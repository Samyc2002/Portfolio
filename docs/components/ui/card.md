# Overview

This file defines a set of React components used to create a visually consistent and stylistically unified card UI element. It provides building blocks for constructing cards with headers, titles, descriptions, content, and footers. These components are designed to be reusable and easily customizable through props.

# Key Features

-   Provides a base `Card` component with a standardized appearance (rounded corners, border, background, shadow).
-   Offers specialized components for different parts of a card, like `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter`.
-   Each component accepts class names for easy styling and customization.
-   Utilizes `React.forwardRef` to allow access to the underlying DOM node.
-   Uses `cn` utility function for easy conditional class name joining.

# Dependencies

-   React
-   `cn` (utility function for class name manipulation, likely from `class-variance-authority`)
