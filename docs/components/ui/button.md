# Overview

This file defines a reusable Button component for a React application. It provides a consistent and customizable button style, handling various visual states and sizes, and offering flexibility through different variants.

# Key Features

-   Provides a styled Button component with pre-defined variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)
-   Supports different sizes (default, small, large, icon) for the Button component.
-   Utilizes `class-variance-authority` for managing CSS class combinations, making it easy to customize the button's appearance.
-   Offers a `asChild` prop using Radix UI's `Slot` component, allowing the button to be rendered as a different HTML element.

# Dependencies

-   React
-   `@radix-ui/react-slot`
-   `class-variance-authority`
-   `clsx` (via `@/lib/utils` which likely contains a `cn` function using `clsx` or similar)
