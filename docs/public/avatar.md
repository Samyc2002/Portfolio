# Overview

This file contains the data for an avatar in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. SVG files use XML-based text format to describe how the image should appear, allowing for scalability without loss of quality.

# Key Features

*   Defines a vector-based image of an avatar.
*   Scalable without quality loss, suitable for various display sizes.
*   Can be embedded directly into HTML or used as a separate image resource.
*   Likely customizable through editing the XML content.
*   Supports various graphical elements such as paths, shapes, and colors.

# Dependencies

*   None. SVG is a standalone format rendered by web browsers and other image viewers, so it doesn't depend on specific external libraries or software during usage.
